# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Project

## Overview
This project implements an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The system takes audio input and converts it into text using a pre-trained model or a custom-trained model. It also includes fine-tuning on the **Speechocean762** dataset for enhanced performance.

## Features
- End-to-end speech-to-text processing
- Support for various speech datasets
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Real-time inference
- Evaluation metrics for performance assessment

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers datasets librosa jiwer
```

Additionally, you may need to install FFmpeg for audio processing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg  # For Linux
brew install ffmpeg          # For macOS
```

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asr-project.git
cd asr-project
```

## Usage

### Training
To train the ASR model, run:

```bash
python train.py --dataset <dataset_name> --epochs 10 --batch_size 16
```

To fine-tune the model specifically on the **Speechocean762** dataset:

```bash
python train.py --dataset speechocean762 --epochs 10 --batch_size 16
```

### Inference
To perform speech-to-text inference on an audio file:

```bash
python infer.py --audio_file example.wav
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using standard ASR metrics:

```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset <dataset_name>
```

## Dataset
This project supports multiple speech datasets, including:
- **Librispeech**
- **Common Voice**
- **TED-LIUM**
- **Speechocean762** (for fine-tuning)

Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format before training.

## Model
This project utilizes transformer-based models such as **Wav2Vec2**, **Whisper**, or **Conformer**. You can choose the model by specifying it in the configuration file or via command-line arguments.

## Configuration
Modify `config.yaml` to customize training parameters, model selection, and hyperparameters.
